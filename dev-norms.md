he way to foster high performing teams._
14. Provide descriptive commit messages. You will forget the details of what you were working on just a few short weeks later.
15. Leverage `pull_request_template.md` to ensure that team members follow all pre-merge instructions. It is 10-100x cheaper for the correct code to be merged and shipped than to release with bugs, incorrect functionality, or security flaws. A sample template was created in your repo.
16. Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
17. Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
18. Write automated tests to cover critical integration points, critical algorithms, business logic, and useful functionality. Don't test autogenerated code or code you don't own (as in ones inherited from frameworks and libraries).
19. Use the feature you just developed before shipping it.
20. If you don't ship it, it never happened.
